1. Download Cygwin.
2. Run the Cygwin installation file.
3. When asked which download source you’d like to use, select “Install from Internet”.
4. Select a root directory where you’d like to install the application. I leave it as the default,  C:\cygwin64
5. Select a directory where you’d like to install your Cygwin packages.
6. Select the method which suits your internet connection type. e.g If you’re not connecting from behind a proxy, select the “Direct Connection” option.
7. Select a mirror to download your packages from. Any option in the list will do. 
8. You’ll then be provided with a list of packages which you can download. Don’t select anything, just click “Next”. Doing so will result in the default applications being installed.
9. When asking if you want to install dependencies, leave everything as their defaults and click “Next”. This will install everything you need to get Cygwin up and running.
10. Double click on the “Cygwin64 Terminal” icon.
11. Set up an alias which points to the “setup-x86_64.exe” file you downloaded in Step 1, like so:
    alias cyg-get="/cygdrive/d/path/to/cygwin/setup-x86_64.exe -q -P"

12. Install the packages required to get Ansible up and running:
    curl cygwin32-gcc-g++ gcc-core gcc-g++ git libffi-devel nano openssl openssl-devel python-crypto python2 python2-devel python2-openssl python2-pip python2-setuptools tree
13. Install Ansible:
    pip install ansible


(Note that if you want to install a specific version, e.g 2.2, append ==2.2  to the end of the command.)
